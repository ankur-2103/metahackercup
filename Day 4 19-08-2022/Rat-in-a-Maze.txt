Problem Statement:
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. 

Example:

Input:
0 = wall, 1 = open area
{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 1}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 1, 1}

Output:
{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 1, 1}
All entries in solution path are marked as 1.

Time Complexity: O(2^(n^2)). 
The recursion can run upper-bound 2^(n^2) times.

Space Complexity: O(n^2). 
Output matrix is required so an extra space of size n*n is needed.
